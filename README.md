Hi, I'm a junior frontend web developer, comfortable showcasing myself as a passionate and dedicated developer through my work rather than words. I have been learning and working seriously on frontend development since 2023. I am very familiar with JavaScript, an incredible library like React JS. By the way, I'm from Dhaka Bangladesh.

Skills:  REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
